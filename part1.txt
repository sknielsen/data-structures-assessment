Linked Lists
1. The boxes are the nodes, the words in "" is the data, the box with the data "Apple" 
    is the head and the box with the data "Cherry" is the tail.
2. Single linked lists only point one direction, where doubly linked lists point to the next
    and backwards to the one before it.
3. Because to append a list means we put a new node at the end and if we know where the tail is
    then we know exactly where to append the new node without traversing the list, so instead of O(n)
    it is O(1).
